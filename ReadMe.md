Hello !

This was an experiment - i wanted to try Blazor when working on this exercise. I enjoyed it as it was new to me. I like the fact that both ui and business logic can be written in C#. I suspect it may not work that well for more complex scenarios but did not I used Mediatr for making the logic spearated from views.

Unfrotunatelly i cannot spend more time on this project. Here are some todos that will make it better:
- Add tests
- Add delete / edit operations
- Add other entities and relations
- Authentication

Thanks to: <br/>
